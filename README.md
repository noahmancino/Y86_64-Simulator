# Toy: A Y-86-64 Machine Simulator

Y-86-64 is a minimal instruction set architecture designed for "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Randal E. 
Bryant and David O'Hallaron. Toy simulates a system with only main memory and registers, interprets Y-86-64 instructions, 
runs them on the system, and displays the state of memory.
